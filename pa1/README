Explanation and domcumentation of the meaning of mode and how we handle modes in our implementation

The mode of a RRQ or WRQ packet is a string  which the packet carries with it, which tells the sender(in this case, the server), 
in which format the file should be, that is being transmitted.
The server uses that information to translate the information in the file accordingly:
		- In the case of "netascii" the server translates it to 8 bit ascii.
		- In the case of "octet" the server translates it to raw 8 bit bytes.
		- The case of "mail" is obsolete in this project and therefore we handle it by returning an error

In our implementation the server recognices all request as if they were netascii, 
but in the case when client requires it to be an octet(with -m "octet"), the server responds by handling the packet with octet.
We found that implementing the handling of mode in this way was best, because it is easiest for the server to handle every packet in
the exact matter of how the client requires.




How our server handles attempts of uploading files:

The implementation of our server only recognices RRQ from the client, in the case where a client request to write, 
the server responds by returning an error, telling the client that he is unable to send a WRQ.
We do this by, after the request from the client has been recieved, we check if the opcode of the request packet is equal to 1, 
an RRQ to be exact, if the opcode is anything else, we assume the client is sending an WRQ and return the error.
